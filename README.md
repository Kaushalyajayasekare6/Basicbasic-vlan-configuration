# Basic VLAN Configuration - Cisco Packet Tracer Project

## ðŸ“š Project Overview
This repository contains a **basic VLAN configuration project** created using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It demonstrates essential VLAN concepts such as:

- Creating VLANs
- Assigning ports to VLANs
- Configuring access ports and trunk ports
- Viewing VLAN configurations with `show` commands
- Saving the configuration

## ðŸ”§ Files in the Repository
| File                    | Description |
|------------------|----------------|
| `basic-switching.pkt` | Cisco Packet Tracer file with the network topology. |
| `vlan_config.txt` | Command-line configuration applied to the switch. |
| `README.md` | Project documentation. |

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Open `basic-switching.pkt` in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Review the `vlan_config.txt` file to understand the applied configuration.
3. Use `show vlan brief` and `show running-config` to view the current switch configuration.
4. Test connectivity between devices within the same VLAN to verify configuration.
